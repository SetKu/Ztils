A collection of Swift utilities to make working with the language and frameworks such as UIKit and SwiftUI easier.

This framework includes quick conveniences for working with often verbose interactions, such as setting up closures to adapt to dynamic type size on iOS. There is also a network manager to make quickly decoding a `Codable` type from a URL quick, painless, and easy. A set of protocols I have found particularily useful in structuring URL schemes can be found with the types `URLSchemeHandler` and `URLSchemeCoordinator`. Both types have corresponding documentation.

This framework is not intended for widespread use and is just a collection of utilities that I utilize in projects. I have not created every solution in this collection, and I have done my best to give proper credit where it is due. However, I may have accidentally missed a solution just given the pure quantity of information and sources one uses when developing.

Go nuts! ðŸ˜€
